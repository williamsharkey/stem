# stem

manipulate stems exported from endlesss.fm

stem combines all the aiffs in a folder, loops them 4 times, mixes them and normalizes them if it clips. but the idea is that it will have other functions, like wuncling


## compile on mac

cc stem.c -o stem

## run

navigate to a folder with .aiff

run "./stem" in your terminal
